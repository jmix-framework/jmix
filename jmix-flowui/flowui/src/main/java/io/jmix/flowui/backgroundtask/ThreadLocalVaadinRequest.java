 * This class mainly used to provide access to Vaadin request within {@link UI#access(Command)} closure in background
 * tasks. It is not recommended to use this class in the application code.
 * <p>
 * Ensure that you clear the thread-local storage after use. Use {@link #clear()} method once the thread-local data is
 * no longer needed.
