    ## Overview

    Jmix Generic REST API provides the following functionality:

    * Entities CRUD operations
    * Execution of predefined JPQL queries
    * Execution of exposed service methods
    * Getting metadata (entities, fetch plans, enumerations, datatypes)
    * Getting localized messages
    * Getting current user permissions (roles, access to entities and attributes, specific policies)
    * Getting attributes of the current user
    * Working with files

    The REST API is available at the `/rest/` URL, e.g. `http://localhost:8080/rest/entities/Order`

    ## Authentication

    ### Authentication using the OAuth2 protocol

    Jmix REST API uses an OAuth2 resource owner password credentials grant to protect the endpoints (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.3).

    Before accessing a protected resource, a user must get an authentication token. The token can be obtained at the `/oauth/token` URL.

    The `/oauth/token` endpoint is protected with the basic authentication. The request must contain the `Authorization` header for basic
    authentication with REST API client credentials. Please note that client credentials are not the same as the user credentials.
    Client means an application that uses the REST API. The default client credentials are defined by the following
    application properties: `jmix.security.oauth2.clientId` and `jmix.security.oauth2.clientSecret`. User credentials must be passed in the request body.
    The request format must be `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

    See the `/oauth/token` endpoint documentation for more details.

    The obtained token must be provided with all subsequent requests in the `Authorization` header of the `Bearer` type, e.g.:

    ```
    GET /rest/entities/Order
         Host: example.com
         Authorization: Bearer 2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA
    ```

    Access token can also be provided in the request URL using the `access_token` parameter. This may be useful when you, for example, need to build
    a link for downloading a file, like this: `http://localhost:8080/rest/files?fileRef=fs://2021/03/12/2266c97c-cf23-c202-481d-04d972e185b4.jpg?name=cat-via-direct-request.jpg?access_token=acefdad0-d728-4279-aae3-6b42620f7ef9`.

    ### Anonymous access

    If the request to a protected resource doesn't contain the `Authentication` header then the user will be authenticated with the anonymous session.
    By default, anonymous access is forbidden. To enable it for a specific URL, add the URL pattern to the `jmix.rest.anonymous-url-patterns` application property.
    Read more about the anonymous sessions in the Jmix documentation.

        Gets an authentication token.

        The endpoint is protected with the basic authentication. The request must contain an `Authorization`
        header for basic authentication with REST API client credentials. Please note that client credentials 
        are not the same as the user credentials. Client means an application that uses the REST API.
        The default client credentials are defined by the following application properties: `jmix.rest.client.id` and `jmix.rest.client.secret`.
        User credentials must be passed in the request body. The request format must be `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

        To disable refresh tokens for the client, set `password,external` value to the
        `jmix.security.oauth2.client-authorized-grant-types` application property.

        may contain references to other entities. These references are processed according to the following rules:

        * If the entity property is annotated with @Composition in the entity java class, then it will be saved with the
        main entity
        * Otherwise a referenced entity with the given id will be searched. If it is found then the saved entity will
        have a reference to it. Otherwise, a response with code 400 will be returned.

      summary: Find entities by filter conditions
      description: |2

        Finds entities by filter conditions. The filter is defined by JSON object that is passed as in URL parameter.

        Filter JSON example:

        ```json
        {
            "conditions": [
                {
                    "group": "OR",
                    "conditions": [
                        {
                            "property": "stringField",
                            "operator": "startsWith",
                            "value": "ABC"
                        },
                        {
                            "property": "relatedEntity.intField",
                            "operator": ">",
                            "value": 100
                        }
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "property": "booleanField",
                    "operator": "=",
                    "value": true
                }
            ]
        }
        ```

        Filter supports OR and AND grouping. All conditions in the root "conditions" field are automatically added to the AND group.

        Conditions for properties that are references to other entities must have values with string representation of
        entitiy primary key.

        If the operator is "in" or "notIn" then the value should be a JSON array.

        ```
        {
            "conditions": [
                {
                    "property": "linkedEntityField",
                    "operator": "=",
                    "value": "2de6a78f-7bef-89a7-eb5e-b725582f23af"
                },
                {
                  "property": "intField",
                  "operator": "in",

      summary: Find entities by filter conditions
      description: |2

        Finds entities by filter conditions. Works like the corresponding GET method, but filter definition and all request parameters are
        passed in the request body as JSON object. All possible parameters ("fetchPlan", "sort", "returnNulls", etc.) are the same as in the
        GET version of the `/search` operation.

        Request body example:

        ```json
        {
            "filter": {
              "conditions": [
                  {
                      "group": "OR",
                      "conditions": [
                          {
                              "property": "stringField",
                              "operator": "startsWith",
                              "value": "ABC"
                          },
                          {
                              "property": "relatedEntity.intField",
                              "operator": ">",
                              "value": 100
                          }
                      ]
                  },
